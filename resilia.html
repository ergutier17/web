			<h1>What about Resilia?</h1>
                    <p>They worked on our soft skills largely: Continuous 
                    Learning, Adaptability, Team work, Problem solving,
                    Leadership and Project management in a simulated
                    Corporate Experience. 
                    We develop Hard Skills too: Software Engineering
                    (mainly RUP) building a big Project Specification in six
                    weeks, then Fundamental Infrastructure (Networking some
                    Linux and PFSense), Security, Front End
                    (HTML/CSS, Web Apps and Javascript), GIT, Databases,
					SQL, BI (Click Sense and Power BI) and finally
                    Back-end (predominantly JAVA) to build a Big 
                    National Project for Brazilian Agribusiness administration.</p>

                <h1>How do I live it?</h1>
                    <p>I had worked deeply in Business and Requirement
                    Analyses of the project and in an UML description and
                    modelling of the Project too. Then little bid of HTML/CSS 
                    making few web pages, and now I am co-working in
                    the Database modelling, the build, the filled, sustain and
                    integration with other datasets for further BI Analysis.
                    Very soon I will work in the exploitation of the data
                    with BI tools to create and present useful information
                    about Brazilian Agribusiness for both producers and
                    decision making government employees.</p>
